hooks are used for modularity,readability,reusability.
we can also make custom hooks by our own with anyname
hooks are the normal helper function
customhooks are used for writing the logic in javascript and it returns the value it is not like the functional component

2.Utilities-Util

these are used for creating helper function or other customhooks to make the components good readability
when using utilities it will be more easy to check the error whenever it occurs ,we dont want to search where we have written and we can directly check the utilities folder

3.Function components

it is a function which returns the jsx.
